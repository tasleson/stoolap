//! A paged secondary index over one integer column of a sealed volume.
//!
//! The side file holds, per indexed column, the distinct keys in order and
//! for each key the ascending row positions that hold it, in pages bounded
//! in bytes: a key page carries keys with the position index each key ends
//! at, a position page carries positions. A small directory names the pages
//! and stays resident with the volume; pages are read on demand into a
//! process-wide cache with a byte budget.
//!
//! Every allocation the index makes is charged to one ledger before it is
//! made, at the capacity it takes, and released when its last owner lets
//! go: a directory for its file's life, a page for as long as any holder
//! keeps it, the raw bytes of a page or a directory while they are parsed,
//! a build's sort run, page buffers, output buffer and merge readers, and a
//! cursor's window. The ledger is accounting with best-effort eviction: a
//! reservation that finds nothing unheld to evict is still granted and
//! counted as over budget. Admission, the rule that refuses or delays an
//! allocation the budget cannot take, is not here; it is a prerequisite of
//! the query integration and is decided there.
//!
//! Layout of `vol_<id>.sidx`:
//!
//! ```text
//! [magic "STSX"][version u32][generation u64]        16 bytes
//! pages, each [n u32][entries][crc32 u32]
//! directory: [column count u32] then per column
//!   [col u32][key tag u8][n_keys u64][n_positions u64][key pages u32][pos pages u32]
//!   key pages: [first_key i64][last_key i64][offset u64][len u32][key_start u64][pos_start u64]
//!   pos pages: [offset u64][len u32][pos_start u64]
//! footer: [directory offset u64][directory len u32][directory crc32 u32][magic]
//! ```
//!
//! The generation in the header is immutable for the file; a page read
//! checks it, and a cache key carries it, so a file replaced under a
//! reader never mixes the reader's directory with the new file's pages.
